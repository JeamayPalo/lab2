If-Else statements

Problem 1: MagicDates 
The date June 10, 1960, is special because when it is written numerically, the month time the day equals the year: 

6/10/60 --> 6*10 = 60 

Design a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year in three separate inputs. The program should determine whether the month times the day equals the year. If so, it should print, "This date is magic!" Otherwise, it should print, "This date is not magic."

Problem 2: ColorMixer 

The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. When you mix two primary colors, you get a secondary color: 

When you mix red and blue, you get purple. 
When you mix red and yellow, you get orange. 
When you mix blue and yellow, you get green. 

Design a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary colors, one at a time. If the user enters anything other than "red," "blue," or "yellow," the program should print "You didn't input two primary colors." Otherwise, it should print something in the format: "When you mix red and blue, you get purple." (Assuming the user entered "red" and "blue‚Äù.) 

Problem 3: TimeCalculator 

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds and then prints the same amount of time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, 3667 seconds is equivalent to 0 days, 1 hour, 1 minute, and 7 seconds. 

Print out the result in the format: "0 day(s), 1 hour(s), 1 minute(s), and 7 second(s)
